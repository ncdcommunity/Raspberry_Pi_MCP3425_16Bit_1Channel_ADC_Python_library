#  MCP3425

The MCP3425 is a 1-Channel Analog to Digital Converter with 16-Bit resolution, ideally suited for low-speed high-resolution sensor monitoring.The MCP3425 is capable of reading analog voltages at 15 samples per second with 16-Bit resolution or 240 samples per second at 12-bit resolution. The MCP3425 has an x1, x2, x4, x8 programmable gain amplifier, making it an ideal choice for monitoring extremely low-voltage sensors. The MCP3425 has a single differential input, capable of monitoring a full scale range of 4.096VDC or Â±2.048v differentially.
